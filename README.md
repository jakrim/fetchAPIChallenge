1. Open an expo project (expo init _app-name_)
2. Created an api-client folder and fetch function to check I am receiving data from the movie API
3. Had to clean and manipulate the data (it was pretty terrible api data...) to only grab one movie, title, image, etc.
4. Created a state slice to hold the movie data with redux-toolkit
5. Used dispatch and useSelector to grab the state - also hooked up the redux store to the app (used Provider from redux)
6. Created the UI -> Not beautifully created using components - with more time I can clean up the styles
7. Extracted SocialLinks and StyledButton to be two reusable components
